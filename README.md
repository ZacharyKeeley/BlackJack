This is a blackjack game I made during my time off from school. It features a working game loop and working AI. The player starts off with 500 chips and can gain or lose those chips based on their luck and skill.
It uses a time based seed to generate random cards. I'm still working on a way to derive a better RNG engine than a time based one (seeing as how a time based RNG engine is predictable).
